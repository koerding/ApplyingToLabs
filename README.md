# Applying to labs at R1 universities
So, you want to be a PhD student or a postdoc at an R1 university. Let us quickly review why.

### Why to apply to labs at R1 universities in the US or Europe
They tend to be well-resourced and do some cool research. They also tend to be great places for networking.

### Why not to apply to such labs
The labs tend to focus on papers and grants. They tend to be less good at teaching than a lot of other places.

## The first big problem: which labs should you apply to
Applying to the wrong lab will not get you an interview and if it does this will not lead to an offer. So lets dive into what are the right labs:
### Right fit for the research
### Right set of skills
### Right level of competitiveness


## The big problem: how to write an email that gets you an interview

### Problem analysis: Most labs get large numbers of applicants - how to make it to the interview
